# Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in a list.

# num = [2, 4, 16, 3, 6, 9]

# num.sort()

# print("largest is ",num[5])
# print("smallest is ", num[0])

# largest = max(num)
# smallest = min(num)
# print("largest num is ", largest)
# print("smallest num is ",smallest )


# Create a list of 10 numbers and calculate the sum and average of all the numbers.

# num = [2, 4, 16, 3, 6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 23]

# sum_num = sum(num)
# avg_num = sum(num)/ len(num)

# print(num)
# print(sum_num)
# print(avg_num)

# Remove duplicates from a list while maintaining the order of elements.

# num = [1,3,3,2,5,8,3,1]

# for i in num:
#   if i not in uniq:
#       uniq.append(i)
       
# print(uniq)



# Create a tuple with 5 numbers and find the index of the largest number.

# tup = (1,3,6,9,5)
# largest = max(tup)
# largest_index = tup.index(largest)

# print(tup)
# print("largest no", largest)
# print("largest no index", largest_index)

# Find the Smallest Number in a List:

# list = [1,2,3,5,5,7]

# smallest = min(list)
# print(smallest)

# print(list.count(5))                          # Find the occurance:
# list.__contains__(7)
# print("yes")

# tup = (3,5)    #tuple
# print(tup.__contains__(3)) 

# list = list(tup)   #convert into list
# print(list)
# list.append(2)     #modify list

# tup1 = tuple(list) #convert back to tuple
# print(tup1)
